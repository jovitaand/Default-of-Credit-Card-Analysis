        "  This study examines the predictive accuracy of six data mining methods for estimating the probability of customer default in Taiwan. Unlike binary classification (credible or not credible), the focus is on estimating the real probability of default, which provides more valuable insights for risk management. A novel Sorting Smoothing Method was introduced to estimate the real probability of default, using it as the response variable (Y) in a simple linear regression model against the predicted probability (X). Results show that the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model outperforms other methods, achieving the highest coefficient of determination. Its regression intercept (A) is near zero, and regression coefficient (B) is close to one, indicating that ANN is the most accurate model for estimating the real probability of default.\n",

        "### 1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning\n",
        "- Handle missing values appropriately.\n",
        "- Group underrepresented categories to improve data representation and robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Model Training and Evaluation\n",
        "- Train a predictive model, such as a decision tree, random forest, or neural network.\n",
        "- Evaluate performance using metrics like **balanced accuracy** to mitigate the effect of class imbalances.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Fairness Analysis\n",
        "- Use tools like **Fairlearn** to assess model fairness and identify disparities across sensitive groups (e.g., gender, race, or age).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Explainability (XAI)\n",
        "- Employ interpretability tools like **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to:\n",
        "  - Highlight features influencing predictions.\n",
        "  - Improve transparency in decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Data Drift Analysis\n",
        "- Utilize **Evidently AI** to monitor changes in data distribution over time and ensure model consistency in deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Propose Solutions\n",
        "- Suggest actionable strategies to mitigate observed biases or ethical concerns, such as:\n",
        "  - Adjusting decision thresholds.\n",
        "  - Implementing pre- or post-processing fairness interventions.\n",

        "#### 1. Feature Correlation Heatmap\n",
        "**High Correlations:**\n",
        "- **CREDIT_UTILIZATION and TOTAL_BILLS**: These features are strongly correlated, as higher credit utilization is often driven by higher total bills.\n",
        "- **TOTAL_BILLS and LIMIT_BAL**: Individuals with higher credit limits tend to have higher total bills.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weak Correlations:**\n",
        "- **AGE**, **MARRIAGE**, **SEX**, and most demographic features show weak correlations with numeric features like **CREDIT_UTILIZATION**, suggesting less direct influence on financial behavior.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Feature Distributions\n",
        "- **LIMIT_BAL (Credit Limit):**\n",
        "  - The distribution is right-skewed, with most values clustering below 300,000.\n",
        "  - Few individuals have exceptionally high limits, creating outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **AGE:**\n",
        "  - A fairly normal distribution, peaking around 30–40 years.\n",
        "  - Few data points for ages above 60.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **CREDIT_UTILIZATION:**\n",
        "  - A right-skewed distribution, with a peak near lower utilization rates.\n",
        "  - A small number of extreme outliers suggest heavy over-utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **AVG_REPAY_DELAY and MAX_REPAY_DELAY:**\n",
        "  - Peaks near 0 indicate that most individuals either repay on time or experience minor delays.\n",
        "  - A smaller portion of extreme delays shows heightened risk behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TOTAL_PAYMENTS and TOTAL_BILLS:**\n",
        "  - Both are heavily right-skewed, with the majority of values concentrated at lower ranges.\n",
        "  - Extreme values likely indicate higher-income individuals or atypical billing patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PAYMENT_TO_BILL_RATIO:**\n",
        "  - Distribution indicates most individuals pay a small fraction of their bills regularly.\n",
        "  - Negative or extreme high ratios likely result from specific billing anomalies or refunds.\n"
